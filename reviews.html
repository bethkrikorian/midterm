    Evan R: Attended a great event here - C ++ Coffee! Learned a lot about C++, met new people, and enjoyed
    a fresh, hot cup of dark roast.

    Macy C: omg absolutely LOVE Coder Café!!! Already followed their social media accounts and told all my friends
    about this place. Catch me studying here all day every day!

    Lane D: Stopped in to grab a coffee on my way to work the other morning. The service was incredible. I was worried
    when I saw the line, but the baristas took care of every customer quickly and efficiently. I’ll be back here on my
    way to work every morning!

    Kyle T: This place is awesome. I’m a tough-to-please cappuccino snob, and this capp was one of the best I’ve ever
    had! Perfect temperature, beautifully foamed milk, and just the right amount of cinnamon on top.

    Cassidy P: I’ve been coming to Coder Café for the cold brew almost every day since it opened. Can’t get enough of it!

    Talia M: What a cute coffee shop! Love the decor and atmosphere - great place to concentrate and do my work. 
    The seating area is quiet and cozy, which is right up my alley. Would love to see banana or zucchini bread in
    the pastry case :)

    “Coder Café has become a second home! The events have introduced me to people I now call my friends, taught me about new 
    programming skills and languages, and, most importantly, introduced my taste buds to new kinds of coffee!”
