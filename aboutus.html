  <h1> Our Story </h1>
	<script type="text/javascript">
    Coder Café was founded in October of 2019 at our location next to Tufts University in Somerville. 
    This up-and-coming area bustles with college students looking for their daily dose of caffeine. </br> 
    We founded Coder Café as four computer science students looking for a nice study atmosphere to claim as our own. 
    Our vision was to provide Tufts students an environment that meets all their needs. </br>
    Whether you’re a student trying to pull an all-nighter or start buzzing at the crack of dawn, a coder looking for
    a place to immerse yourself in your work and find a place to feel at home, or just another person looking for good coffee,
    </br> we have you covered! We strive to create your ideal atmosphere, great opportunities for growth as a coder, and even
    better coffee! 
    </br>
    Everything we do is for you - our menu, high quality products, location, atmosphere, and events. 
    </br>
    Enjoy! 
    </br>
    Becca, Beth, Dogacan, and Erce
